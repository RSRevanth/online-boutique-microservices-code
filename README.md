1. Code Checkout: 
2. Code Analysis(sonarqube): 
3. Docker build,tag scan and push(ecr and trivy):
4. Updating kube context(eks)  
5. Deploy application to Dev Environment(kubernetes):  
6. Monitoring(prometheous and grafana): 


Sure, here's a brief explanation of each step:

1. **Code Checkout**: Retrieving the latest version of the source code from a version control system like Git, enabling developers to work on the most up-to-date codebase.

2. **Code Analysis (SonarQube)**: Performing static code analysis using SonarQube to identify and report code quality issues, security vulnerabilities, and bugs in the codebase, ensuring higher code maintainability and reliability.

3. **Docker build, tag, scan, and push (ECR and Trivy)**: Building Docker images from the application code, tagging them appropriately, scanning for security vulnerabilities using Trivy, and pushing them to the Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) for secure storage and distribution.

4. **Updating kube context (EKS)**: Updating the Kubernetes context to configure the Kubernetes command-line tool (kubectl) to interact with the correct Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster, ensuring that subsequent commands are executed against the intended environment.

5. **Deploy application to Dev Environment (Kubernetes)**: Deploying the application to a development environment managed by Kubernetes, orchestrating containers and resources to ensure the application runs smoothly and efficiently.

6. **Monitoring (Prometheus and Grafana)**: Setting up monitoring using Prometheus for collecting metrics and Grafana for visualization and alerting, allowing teams to track the performance, health, and usage of the deployed application and infrastructure components in real-time.
